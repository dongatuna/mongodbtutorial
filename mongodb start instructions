mongodb start instructions	

go to the root: C:\
cd into data folder: cd data
run "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe"

npm init: start the package.json file

Databases contain collections and collections contain models.
Models have attributes.  Schema describe models

Will use mocha testing to:
 --test our connection with the database
 --create records
 --read records
 --update records
 --delete records

 3 Mongoose methods for deleting reocrds
 --char.remove() //this is called on a single instance
 --MarioChar.remove() //this refers to model itself -- can pass criteria for models you want deleted e.g. 
 --MarioChar.findOneAndRemove() //refers to the first one and removes it

 Mongoose methods for updating records
 -- char.update()
 -- MarioChar.update()
 -- MarioChar.findOneAndUpdate()

The process for creating/updating
Create and save a new record to the db
Use findAndUpdate to update the name of the record
Try to findOne int the db (the one we have just updated)
Assert that the result has the updated property value
